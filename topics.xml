          DEATH IN THE DYNAMO
          "How would you uso electricity?"
          "Just seo here," said Dr. Southwick,
          jumping up and .seating himself, in an arm
          chair. "Tho condemned man cansifc natur
          ally in a chair like this, placo his liands on
          the metal arms and converse with those
          around him. Tho metal plates would ba
          connected with a powerful d3namo and at
          tho proper moment somebody in another
          room would press a button, closo tho current
          and tho fatal shock would pass through tho
          body of the subject. Tho chargo would go
          straight through tho heart and lungs and
          penetrate the system, death instantly result
          ing. Tho expense of the apparatus with which
          to execute by electricity ia this city would
          bo about $150. Connection cculd bo made
          with the electric light station, and tho ex
          pense of an execution thereafter would bo of
          littlo consequence. It would not cost any
          more than a cigar to kill a condemned man
          after that. It would not bo necessary to
          maintain extensive and powerful machinery
          in nil tho prisons, anil it would bo vastly
          cheaper than hanging."
          "You believe then in electricity?'
          "Electricity Ls tho coming power. Death
          is instantaneous and tho body i not defaced.
          There is not tho morbidness of n hanging,
          which is a relic cf barbarism. Just seo a
          recent execution here Heman's I think it
          was when tho hanged man breathed fifteen
          minutes afteV the drop fell. If that is in
          stantaneous death then I would rather havo
          u lingering death."

          Regarding tho machinery to Iw used
          Senator llcl.lillan says: "Theso 'executions
          could take place in tho jail proper, in a room
          set apart for that purpose, with no appli
          ances save that of a chair, with tuo nana
          rest of each arm properly connected with
          an electric machine, in which tho condemned
          might bo seated and tho connection made by
          strapping a hand to the hand rest on each
          chair. There can bo no difficulty whatever
          in procuring a current of electricity of suffi
          cient strength to paralyze tho muscles of
          tho heart by this method. Indeed, tho cur
          rent that is used in this city for electric
          lighting purposes is of sufficient strength to
          absolutely dismember the body of nay human
          being, but a current of electricity of suffi
          cient strength to cause instantaneous death
          by passing from hand to hand through the
          heart wi'l not mark the body in tho least."

          A PLAN PROPOSED
          gow Will Electrical Execu
          tions Be Accomplished?
          TlE LAST THING IN KILLING.
          How Various Nations Do Their Criminals
          to Death--New TYok State the Flrat
          commeunty to Adapt the Newest Thing
          in Capital PlUnihment.
          After Jan. 1, 1880, murderers in New York
          sate will depart this life on a streak of light
          ing. Any man who has been sentenced to
          death will go off. so quick that he won't
          know anything about it. The subject of
          putting murderers to death by electricity has
          been agitated in the Empire state for more
          than a year.
          After mature deliberation it was concluded
          that hanging would have to go.
          Hanging has been the fashionable mode of
          punishment for centuries, but a commission
          *appointed by Governor Hill concluded that it
          was too harrowing. They made a number
          of experiments, and finally decided upon
          electricity. A bill was passed by the legis
          lature, but-no provision was made as to the
          way the fluid was to be applied. Finally the
          Medico-legal society took the matter Uo, ap
          pointed a commission, and the result was
          that a particular form of applying the elec
          tricity was suggested. This way of killing
          off the refuse population will probably be
          used in New York state hereafter. Three
          ways of applying the fatal electricity were
          proposed, but none of them answered the
          purpose. One was passing the electri.
          iots city from wrist to
          wrist through the
          body, another
          was passing the
          current from the
          head to one of the
          wrists, the third
          Swas topassthecmu
          rent completely
          t through the prison.
          S1 etr's body from head
          to foot.
          c c m The objections to
          A CURRENT IN THE BRAIn these methods were
          that the prisoner might have convulsions.
          It was desired, of course, to take the utmost
          care of the prisoner. He was to die as pleas
          antly as possible. Then the attendant under
          this method might make a mistake and be
          struck himself.
          The commission finally concluded that the
          best way would be to have the current pass
          through the hoad from the top to the back of
          the neck. One electrode is fitted to the top
          of the prisoner's head, another placed in con
          tact with the small of his back. The top
          electrode connects with the positive pole, the
          bottom with the negative pole. A leathern
          rest holds the prisoner's head and bands
          keep him from moving. The current, in go
          ing from one electrode to another, does not
          keep in a straight line, but spreads out and
          goes through the entire brain. It resembles
          somewhat a bundle of faggots tied at the two
          ends and swelling out in the middle. The seat
          of consciousness being in the brain, and the
          headquarters for all the nerves being located
          there, it is of course as plain as day that,
          when an electro-motive force of 8, 30 volts
          is applied, the prisoner is bound to die. The
          great beauty of this system is that the pris
          oners don't know it either.

          9 VICTIMS FOR DEATH CHAIR IN ONE DAY
          NKW YORK. Aug. 10- Twenty-two
          jears ago this week, on August C,
          1890, William Kemmlcr, a condemned
          murderer, was put to death In the
          electric chair In Auburn prison. Kern.
          mler ttas the first victim to be legal
          ly executed by electricity in tb Unit
          ed States and his case was the sub
          ject of wide discussion at the time.
          The action of New York In substitut
          ing the electric chair for the gallows
          has been found generally satisfact
          ory and her example has been fol
          lowed by Ohio, Virginia, South Caro
          lina, Massachusetts, Kentucky auJ
          New Jersey.
          ijlnce the execution of Kemmler
          there hae been 151 persona put to
          death In the electric chair In New
          York. The state prison authorities
          estimate that It costs about J4000 per
          individual to carry, out the capital
          punishment mandate. On the basis
          of Oils estimate New York state haa
          expended about JC3.000 for electro
          cutions since that form of Inflicting
          the death penalty was introduced.
          Several times the electric chair at
          Sing Sing has had two victims in
          one day, and on one occasion a short
          time ago three persons were put to
          death within a period of twenty-four
          hours. Rut never before has there
          been such a wholesale execution of
          death sentences Imposed on prison
          ers In this state as is scheduled to
          take place at Sing Sing next week.
          Nino men are to die on the same
          day, and In as rapid succession H3
          they can be led to the death chair.
          -:ix of the nine prospective victims
          are the Italians who were convicted
          of the atrocious murder of Mrs Mary
          Hall at Croton Id Kit. Westchester
          County, on Nov 9, 1911.

          Electric Chair Gets Men Who Murdered Rosenthal
          Three Shocks Given.
          The first shock lasted a full minute
          and the executioner said that it was
          1,850 volts and ten aniperes in
          strength. It came while Becker was
          still commending his soul to his
          niflknr.
          I The two prison physicians stepped
          forward to examine the collapsed flg
          ure that sat supported in the death
          chair by the thick black leather straps.
          The stethoscope was applied to the
          heart and Dr. Charles Farr, the prison
          physician, pressed his finger against
          the artery in the neck. There was
          still a feeble fluttering of the heart.'
          The physician stepped back from
          the rubber mat and again the electric
          current pulsed through the body. The
          shock lasted seven seconds and the
          current was then turned off. After 4
          hasty examination Dr. Farr asked that
          a third shock be given. This lasted
          nve seconds. An examination that
          took several minutes followed. Three
          physicians among the witnesses then
          made an examination and Dr.- Farr at
          5:55 o'clock proriounced Becker dead.

          TWO ELECTROCUTED
          IN KENTUCKY JAIL
          Eddyville, Ky., July 30—For the
          third time in the history of Kentucky
          a double electrocution took place this
          morning at 3:30 o'clock at the Eddy
          ville penintiary.
          The firBt to be executed was Turn
          er Graham, Jr., 24, a white man, con
          victed for the killing of R. J. Mc
          Murtry, sheriff of Hardin county. The
          second was William Lane, 25, a negro,
          convicted at Pineville, on a charge of
          killing his wife. Lane was the first
          negro to be executed in Kentucky
          since the adoption of electrocution as
          a means of inflicting the death pen
          alty. Both men passed the night
          calmly and walked unassisted to the
          death chamber.

          How it feels to die in the electric chair
          Scientists Have Just Discovered
          Many Secrets Which Have Long
          Puzzled Them in Regard to Death
          by Electric Shock From the Exper
          ience of a Man Who Was Electro
          cuted and Brought
          Back to Life
          WHKN the electric chair was sub
          stituted for the old fashioned
          gallows in New York it was be
          cause it was believed that electrocution
          was painless. But just what were the
          sensations of death in the electric chair
          scientists were unable to say, because
          no electrocuted victim came back to life
          to tell tliern.
          It was assumed that the shock of the
          powerful current would instantly render
          the condemned man unconscious. But
          the unpleasant feature of m^st electro
          cutions has been the necessity of re
          penting the shock several times. This
          was not foreseen
          Experience in ilie death chamber has
          shown that the electric current does
          not usually destroy life at the tirst shock.
          Evidences of pulsating life compel the
          executioner to turn on the current asain
          and yet again. This distressing failure
          of the electric charge to instantly end
          life has caused much speculation among
          scientists and humanitarians.
          Does the first shock end the conscious
          ness of the condemned man?
          Or is the victim siiil conscious?hover
          ing between death and life, does themau
          In the chair realize what is going on?
          What, if any, was the agony of the
          ti rs shock?
          What were the agonies of the victim
          during the moments elapsing between
          tiie tirst shock and the second impact of
          the current? Was he entirely uncon
          scious, partly conscious or fully conscious
          of the horrors of the situation which the
          law never meant to be inflicted on him?
          And if the tirst shock of the current
          benumbed the condemned man's brain,
          did returning consciousness bring with it
          tortures of bodily misery which have
          never been known or suspected?

          never been an electric execution and
          everybody was prospecting as to who
          would be the first person electrocuted
          and'whether he would bo killed with
          out conscious suffering or tortured to
          death. f
          On October 30, 1889, Warden Brush
          received Charles McElvalne, aged
          twenty, the first person sentenced to
          the electric-' chair., He had- slain
          Christian Lucca In Brooklyn. There
          had been no deathhouse built then.
          So"McElvalne was placed' in a cell on
          the upper floor of tho hospital building

          December 5, 1889, work of building tho
          deathhouse was begun. It was to be,
          virtually, a prison within a prison.
          Derrenbachcr saw Thomas Palllster,
          a prisoner, helping to build it. By
          an odd turn of events, this same pris
          oner was later convicted of murder
          and lodged, two years later, in the
          prison death cells himself. He was
          never executed. He cheated the chair
          by escaping,

          ELECTRIC CHAIR IS BARBAROUS,
          NOTED DANISH PHYSICIAN HOLDS
          COPENHAGEN, Denmark, Nov
          ^2—Three famous Danish physi
          cians have launched an attack on
          the electric chair, .which they
          t-etm “an American barbarity.”
          ihrfife Toncifi' in thri bqjiof
          'tniit the electric chair 'does' hot
          kill. It merely paralyzes the vie
          tint, the physicians declare, and
          the prison doctor completes the
          execution by failing to revive the
          person shocked.
          Dr. Marius Claudius, chief of
          Urn laboratory of one of Copen
          hagen’s largest hospitals, de
          nounces the electric chair in a'
          article in the journal Polltiken.
          Dr. Viggo Christiansen, famous
          nerve specialist, president of the
          Danish Medical Society, Danish
          government medical counsellor
          and a member of the American
          League of Mental Hygiene, sup I
          ports Dr. Claudius in another arti-
          cle. in which he says:
          "Tho stopping of breathing and
          the heart beat is no sign what
          ever of death. Death rigidity 01
          spots gives the only safe right tc
          declare a mnn dead. Thus in oui
          hospitals nobody must be removed
          from bed before six hours aftei
          the supposed death.
          "Whether the victim suffers af
          tor the electrocution is a hare
          question to answer, but, of course
          there Is iro suffering If the eon
          sciousneSs—which must be sup
          posed—is paralyzed too."
          Dr. Claudius calls death in the
          electric chair "incredible rude
          ness. and executioner work on the
          part of assisting doctors, who b.
          foul their exalted science."
          “To speak of death in tire elec
          tric chair as humane," he writes,
          “is a simple lie. as nobody dies
          in the electric chair. The great
          est authority on electrophysiology.
          Professor Jellinek of Vienna, says
          that electricity never kills, but
          only paralyzes the centers of
          breathing and the it-■art func
          tions. Kven persons hit by light
          ning can be saved if help comes
          in time. Dissection never shows
          any changes in the body causod
          by the current, a»d the electric
          chair therefore only acts like the
          stopping of the pendulum of a
          clock, not spoiling the main work.
          The executioners’ work in Amer
          ica is now really done by physi
          cians.”
          Professor Knud Sand, head of
          the Law-Medical Institute, adds
          his voice of protest.
          "The point is,” he declares,
          “that death by electricity in most
          cases must be considered uncer
          tain. It is absolutely wrong to
          declare a man dead after the elec- J
          trie chair has stopped his breath- j
          ing and heart heat.”

          DIE IN ELECTRIC CHAIR
          Miami’s two most notorious
          criminal characters died in the
          electric chair at the state peni
          tentiary Monday. The Rjjiford
          prison had held them in the death
          house for over a year, but the
          curtain of justice fell before them
          just five days ago.
          George Anderson, th3 pistol
          whipping, slight built, bad man
          and his accomplice in crime,
          Percy Ambrister, walked to the
          mahogony electric chair calmly.
          Limpy chanted a self-composed
          spiritual as he was strapped in
          the death chair, and Wassie Blue’s:
          last words were, “God bless all of
          you.”
          The prison executioner threw
          the switch on the black-hooded
          Limpy at 8:34 and 12 minutes
          later the same death-dealing high
          voltage charge coursed through
          Blue’s body. Beth men were pro
          nounced dead exactly six minutes
          after they got the current, but
          both were crobably dead minutes
          before the doctor placed a steth
          escope over the heart and found
          no sign of life.
          Arrangements were being made
          this week to return the bodies to
          Miami for burial. It is reported
          that Ambrister’Si wife reneged on
          signing the order. Ambrister’s
          immediate family and relatives of
          Andersen were said to be in ac
          cord with the idea.
          After execution the bodies were
          released to a funeral home in
          Starke, for embalming and final
          disposition pending family re
          quests.
          Limpy was 34 years old and
          Wassie Blue 25.
