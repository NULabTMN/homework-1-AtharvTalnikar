          DEATH IN THE DYNAMO
          "How would you uso electricity?"
          "Just seo here," said Dr. Southwick,
          jumping up and .seating himself, in an arm
          chair. "Tho condemned man cansifc natur
          ally in a chair like this, placo his liands on
          the metal arms and converse with those
          around him. Tho metal plates would ba
          connected with a powerful d3namo and at
          tho proper moment somebody in another
          room would press a button, closo tho current
          and tho fatal shock would pass through tho
          body of the subject. Tho chargo would go
          straight through tho heart and lungs and
          penetrate the system, death instantly result
          ing. Tho expense of the apparatus with which
          to execute by electricity ia this city would
          bo about $150. Connection cculd bo made
          with the electric light station, and tho ex
          pense of an execution thereafter would bo of
          littlo consequence. It would not cost any
          more than a cigar to kill a condemned man
          after that. It would not bo necessary to
          maintain extensive and powerful machinery
          in nil tho prisons, anil it would bo vastly
          cheaper than hanging."
          "You believe then in electricity?'
          "Electricity Ls tho coming power. Death
          is instantaneous and tho body i not defaced.
          There is not tho morbidness of n hanging,
          which is a relic cf barbarism. Just seo a
          recent execution here Heman's I think it
          was when tho hanged man breathed fifteen
          minutes afteV the drop fell. If that is in
          stantaneous death then I would rather havo
          u lingering death."

          Regarding tho machinery to Iw used
          Senator llcl.lillan says: "Theso 'executions
          could take place in tho jail proper, in a room
          set apart for that purpose, with no appli
          ances save that of a chair, with tuo nana
          rest of each arm properly connected with
          an electric machine, in which tho condemned
          might bo seated and tho connection made by
          strapping a hand to the hand rest on each
          chair. There can bo no difficulty whatever
          in procuring a current of electricity of suffi
          cient strength to paralyze tho muscles of
          tho heart by this method. Indeed, tho cur
          rent that is used in this city for electric
          lighting purposes is of sufficient strength to
          absolutely dismember the body of nay human
          being, but a current of electricity of suffi
          cient strength to cause instantaneous death
          by passing from hand to hand through the
          heart wi'l not mark the body in tho least."

          A PLAN PROPOSED
          gow Will Electrical Execu
          tions Be Accomplished?
          TlE LAST THING IN KILLING.
          How Various Nations Do Their Criminals
          to Death--New TYok State the Flrat
          commeunty to Adapt the Newest Thing
          in Capital PlUnihment.
          After Jan. 1, 1880, murderers in New York
          sate will depart this life on a streak of light
          ing. Any man who has been sentenced to
          death will go off. so quick that he won't
          know anything about it. The subject of
          putting murderers to death by electricity has
          been agitated in the Empire state for more
          than a year.
          After mature deliberation it was concluded
          that hanging would have to go.
          Hanging has been the fashionable mode of
          punishment for centuries, but a commission
          *appointed by Governor Hill concluded that it
          was too harrowing. They made a number
          of experiments, and finally decided upon
          electricity. A bill was passed by the legis
          lature, but-no provision was made as to the
          way the fluid was to be applied. Finally the
          Medico-legal society took the matter Uo, ap
          pointed a commission, and the result was
          that a particular form of applying the elec
          tricity was suggested. This way of killing
          off the refuse population will probably be
          used in New York state hereafter. Three
          ways of applying the fatal electricity were
          proposed, but none of them answered the
          purpose. One was passing the electri.
          iots city from wrist to
          wrist through the
          body, another
          was passing the
          current from the
          head to one of the
          wrists, the third
          Swas topassthecmu
          rent completely
          t through the prison.
          S1 etr's body from head
          to foot.
          c c m The objections to
          A CURRENT IN THE BRAIn these methods were
          that the prisoner might have convulsions.
          It was desired, of course, to take the utmost
          care of the prisoner. He was to die as pleas
          antly as possible. Then the attendant under
          this method might make a mistake and be
          struck himself.
          The commission finally concluded that the
          best way would be to have the current pass
          through the hoad from the top to the back of
          the neck. One electrode is fitted to the top
          of the prisoner's head, another placed in con
          tact with the small of his back. The top
          electrode connects with the positive pole, the
          bottom with the negative pole. A leathern
          rest holds the prisoner's head and bands
          keep him from moving. The current, in go
          ing from one electrode to another, does not
          keep in a straight line, but spreads out and
          goes through the entire brain. It resembles
          somewhat a bundle of faggots tied at the two
          ends and swelling out in the middle. The seat
          of consciousness being in the brain, and the
          headquarters for all the nerves being located
          there, it is of course as plain as day that,
          when an electro-motive force of 8, 30 volts
          is applied, the prisoner is bound to die. The
          great beauty of this system is that the pris
          oners don't know it either.

          9 VICTIMS FOR DEATH CHAIR IN ONE DAY
          NKW YORK. Aug. 10- Twenty-two
          jears ago this week, on August C,
          1890, William Kemmlcr, a condemned
          murderer, was put to death In the
          electric chair In Auburn prison. Kern.
          mler ttas the first victim to be legal
          ly executed by electricity in tb Unit
          ed States and his case was the sub
          ject of wide discussion at the time.
          The action of New York In substitut
          ing the electric chair for the gallows
          has been found generally satisfact
          ory and her example has been fol
          lowed by Ohio, Virginia, South Caro
          lina, Massachusetts, Kentucky auJ
          New Jersey.
          ijlnce the execution of Kemmler
          there hae been 151 persona put to
          death In the electric chair In New
          York. The state prison authorities
          estimate that It costs about J4000 per
          individual to carry, out the capital
          punishment mandate. On the basis
          of Oils estimate New York state haa
          expended about JC3.000 for electro
          cutions since that form of Inflicting
          the death penalty was introduced.
          Several times the electric chair at
          Sing Sing has had two victims in
          one day, and on one occasion a short
          time ago three persons were put to
          death within a period of twenty-four
          hours. Rut never before has there
          been such a wholesale execution of
          death sentences Imposed on prison
          ers In this state as is scheduled to
          take place at Sing Sing next week.
          Nino men are to die on the same
          day, and In as rapid succession H3
          they can be led to the death chair.
          -:ix of the nine prospective victims
          are the Italians who were convicted
          of the atrocious murder of Mrs Mary
          Hall at Croton Id Kit. Westchester
          County, on Nov 9, 1911.

          Electric Chair Gets Men Who Murdered Rosenthal
          Three Shocks Given.
          The first shock lasted a full minute
          and the executioner said that it was
          1,850 volts and ten aniperes in
          strength. It came while Becker was
          still commending his soul to his
          niflknr.
          I The two prison physicians stepped
          forward to examine the collapsed flg
          ure that sat supported in the death
          chair by the thick black leather straps.
          The stethoscope was applied to the
          heart and Dr. Charles Farr, the prison
          physician, pressed his finger against
          the artery in the neck. There was
          still a feeble fluttering of the heart.'
          The physician stepped back from
          the rubber mat and again the electric
          current pulsed through the body. The
          shock lasted seven seconds and the
          current was then turned off. After 4
          hasty examination Dr. Farr asked that
          a third shock be given. This lasted
          nve seconds. An examination that
          took several minutes followed. Three
          physicians among the witnesses then
          made an examination and Dr.- Farr at
          5:55 o'clock proriounced Becker dead.

          TWO ELECTROCUTED
          IN KENTUCKY JAIL
          Eddyville, Ky., July 30—For the
          third time in the history of Kentucky
          a double electrocution took place this
          morning at 3:30 o'clock at the Eddy
          ville penintiary.
          The firBt to be executed was Turn
          er Graham, Jr., 24, a white man, con
          victed for the killing of R. J. Mc
          Murtry, sheriff of Hardin county. The
          second was William Lane, 25, a negro,
          convicted at Pineville, on a charge of
          killing his wife. Lane was the first
          negro to be executed in Kentucky
          since the adoption of electrocution as
          a means of inflicting the death pen
          alty. Both men passed the night
          calmly and walked unassisted to the
          death chamber.

          How it feels to die in the electric chair
          Scientists Have Just Discovered
          Many Secrets Which Have Long
          Puzzled Them in Regard to Death
          by Electric Shock From the Exper
          ience of a Man Who Was Electro
          cuted and Brought
          Back to Life
          WHKN the electric chair was sub
          stituted for the old fashioned
          gallows in New York it was be
          cause it was believed that electrocution
          was painless. But just what were the
          sensations of death in the electric chair
          scientists were unable to say, because
          no electrocuted victim came back to life
          to tell tliern.
          It was assumed that the shock of the
          powerful current would instantly render
          the condemned man unconscious. But
          the unpleasant feature of m^st electro
          cutions has been the necessity of re
          penting the shock several times. This
          was not foreseen
          Experience in ilie death chamber has
          shown that the electric current does
          not usually destroy life at the tirst shock.
          Evidences of pulsating life compel the
          executioner to turn on the current asain
          and yet again. This distressing failure
          of the electric charge to instantly end
          life has caused much speculation among
          scientists and humanitarians.
          Does the first shock end the conscious
          ness of the condemned man?
          Or is the victim siiil conscious?hover
          ing between death and life, does themau
          In the chair realize what is going on?
          What, if any, was the agony of the
          ti rs shock?
          What were the agonies of the victim
          during the moments elapsing between
          tiie tirst shock and the second impact of
          the current? Was he entirely uncon
          scious, partly conscious or fully conscious
          of the horrors of the situation which the
          law never meant to be inflicted on him?
          And if the tirst shock of the current
          benumbed the condemned man's brain,
          did returning consciousness bring with it
          tortures of bodily misery which have
          never been known or suspected?

          never been an electric execution and
          everybody was prospecting as to who
          would be the first person electrocuted
          and'whether he would bo killed with
          out conscious suffering or tortured to
          death. f
          On October 30, 1889, Warden Brush
          received Charles McElvalne, aged
          twenty, the first person sentenced to
          the electric-' chair., He had- slain
          Christian Lucca In Brooklyn. There
          had been no deathhouse built then.
          So"McElvalne was placed' in a cell on
          the upper floor of tho hospital building
          end kepA In 'solitary conflneme'nt;-' On
          December 5, 1889, work of building tho
          deathhouse was begun. It was to be,
          virtually, a prison within a prison.
          Derrenbachcr saw Thomas Palllster,
          a prisoner, helping to build it. By
          an odd turn of events, this same pris
          oner was later convicted of murder
          and lodged, two years later, in the
          prison death cells himself. He was
          never executed. He cheated the chair
          by escaping,

          ELECTRIC CHAIR IS BARBAROUS,
          NOTED DANISH PHYSICIAN HOLDS
          COPENHAGEN, Denmark, Nov
          ^2—Three famous Danish physi
          cians have launched an attack on
          the electric chair, .which they
          t-etm “an American barbarity.”
          ihrfife Toncifi' in thri bqjiof
          'tniit the electric chair 'does' hot
          kill. It merely paralyzes the vie
          tint, the physicians declare, and
          the prison doctor completes the
          execution by failing to revive the
          person shocked.
          Dr. Marius Claudius, chief of
          Urn laboratory of one of Copen
          hagen’s largest hospitals, de
          nounces the electric chair in a'
          article in the journal Polltiken.
          Dr. Viggo Christiansen, famous
          nerve specialist, president of the
          Danish Medical Society, Danish
          government medical counsellor
          and a member of the American
          League of Mental Hygiene, sup I
          ports Dr. Claudius in another arti-
          cle. in which he says:
          "Tho stopping of breathing and
          the heart beat is no sign what
          ever of death. Death rigidity 01
          spots gives the only safe right tc
          declare a mnn dead. Thus in oui
          hospitals nobody must be removed
          from bed before six hours aftei
          the supposed death.
          "Whether the victim suffers af
          tor the electrocution is a hare
          question to answer, but, of course
          there Is iro suffering If the eon
          sciousneSs—which must be sup
          posed—is paralyzed too."
          Dr. Claudius calls death in the
          electric chair "incredible rude
          ness. and executioner work on the
          part of assisting doctors, who b.
          foul their exalted science."
          “To speak of death in tire elec
          tric chair as humane," he writes,
          “is a simple lie. as nobody dies
          in the electric chair. The great
          est authority on electrophysiology.
          Professor Jellinek of Vienna, says
          that electricity never kills, but
          only paralyzes the centers of
          breathing and the it-■art func
          tions. Kven persons hit by light
          ning can be saved if help comes
          in time. Dissection never shows
          any changes in the body causod
          by the current, a»d the electric
          chair therefore only acts like the
          stopping of the pendulum of a
          clock, not spoiling the main work.
          The executioners’ work in Amer
          ica is now really done by physi
          cians.”
          Professor Knud Sand, head of
          the Law-Medical Institute, adds
          his voice of protest.
          "The point is,” he declares,
          “that death by electricity in most
          cases must be considered uncer
          tain. It is absolutely wrong to
          declare a man dead after the elec- J
          trie chair has stopped his breath- j
          ing and heart heat.”

          DIE IN ELECTRIC CHAIR
          Miami’s two most notorious
          criminal characters died in the
          electric chair at the state peni
          tentiary Monday. The Rjjiford
          prison had held them in the death
          house for over a year, but the
          curtain of justice fell before them
          just five days ago.
          George Anderson, th3 pistol
          whipping, slight built, bad man
          and his accomplice in crime,
          Percy Ambrister, walked to the
          mahogony electric chair calmly.
          Limpy chanted a self-composed
          spiritual as he was strapped in
          the death chair, and Wassie Blue’s:
          last words were, “God bless all of
          you.”
          The prison executioner threw
          the switch on the black-hooded
          Limpy at 8:34 and 12 minutes
          later the same death-dealing high
          voltage charge coursed through
          Blue’s body. Beth men were pro
          nounced dead exactly six minutes
          after they got the current, but
          both were crobably dead minutes
          before the doctor placed a steth
          escope over the heart and found
          no sign of life.
          Arrangements were being made
          this week to return the bodies to
          Miami for burial. It is reported
          that Ambrister’Si wife reneged on
          signing the order. Ambrister’s
          immediate family and relatives of
          Andersen were said to be in ac
          cord with the idea.
          After execution the bodies were
          released to a funeral home in
          Starke, for embalming and final
          disposition pending family re
          quests.
          Limpy was 34 years old and
          Wassie Blue 25.

          THE RUSSIAN TREATY.
          This treaty, annexing the Russian posses?
          sions in North America to the United States,
          has been ratified, and we have the satisfaction
          of knowing that when wc do get back into the
          Union, it will be a considerably larger Union
          than when wc left it. There appears to be
          some doubt as to the character and extent of
          the advantages of which we will then be par?
          takers. Tho most liberal statement of the i
          friends of the treaty, embrace positive coal j
          mines, possible gold mines, a sufficient supply
          of furs, a surplus of fish, and ice enough to
          make a national ice-house, and to do away
          with the necessity of a protective tariff on the
          domestic manufacture of that very important
          article.

          The Ceded Territory.
          The cesion of Bussian North Ameri
          ca to tbe United States, if consummated,
          will be tbe most important international
          event affecting this continent which bas
          occurred in many years. Snch an unim
          portant part has Bosnian-America played
          in the affairs of nations andof men, that,
          when an offer for its cession from one
          nower to another is made known, the an
          nouncement conjures np in the mind of
          nearly every one visions ol a cold, bar
          ren and uninhabited region, converging
          about Bebringe strait, and celebrated
          only because Capt. Beecby and Sir John
          Fraklin voyaged on its coasts. But in
          this resuscitation of school day memo-
          lies, or even in a casual glance at tbe
          map of the continent itself, the raot im
          portant parts of the territory wonld mot
          likely escape notice. These are the pe
          ninsula of Alaska and the archipelagoes
          known as George 111, and Prince of
          Wnles, rather peculiar names for a series
          of islands forming part of the pos-esnions
          of the Bnstian Bear. It h noticeable,
          however, that tbe Russians kno'v the is
          lands hy other names, and the one nam
          ed George III., by Vancouver, forming
          part of tbe archipelago generally known
          by tlin name of tlMt monarch, fs by them
          called Baranoy. These inlands are form
          ed by inlets of the ocein,- and are more

          When Secretary Seward purchased
          Alaska from Russia in 1867 for $7,200,000
          the anti-expansionists of that period ridi
          culed the transaction as a piece of su
          preme folly and the public generally
          agreed that he had bought nothing in par
          ticular except a few fur seals and a vast
          expanse of Icebergs and glaciers.
          The commerce of Alaska for the year
          ending June 30, 1903, amounted to over
          $21,000,000, not including the gold out
          put, which would add nearly $5,000,000
          more.' It is officially stated that since
          Alaska became American territory it has
          exported furs, fish and gold in about equal
          values to the amount of $150,000,000, while
          investments of American capital In Alaska
          have reached $25,000,000.

          To the vast majority of i
          ka is a frigid, barren, valm
          of country. It has never si
          Aid!'
          or interest in the hearts and mind
          of tha masses. Doubtless there are
          thousands who cherish the same sen
          timents towards the cold timer that
          were entertained by the opponents of
          the Alaska purchase thirty years ago.
          Congressman Ferris then said that it
          was a "wretched, God-forsaken region,
          with absolutely notning of value"; and
          he moved that the bill authorizing the
          president to pay $7,500,000 for it be
          amended to read "to pay the sum to
          any European. Asiatic or African pow
          er that would take Alaska off our
          hands." Congressman Price declared
          that the payment would be a dead loss
          to the country. Gen Butler proposed
          that, If we must buy the friendship of
          Russia, we give her $7,500,000 and let
          her keep Alaska; and he denounced
          those who favored the acquisition as
          being Insane enough to buy the earth
          quakes of St. Thomas and the Icefields
          of Greenland. Such sentiments, in
          view of the value of Alaska, as at pres
          ent understood by every well-informed
          person, appear almost like the babbling
          of idiocy. We paid 2 cents an acre
          for the territory, the area being 369.
          529,600 acres. The Alaska Fur com
          pany have taken $33,000,000 worth of
          seal skins, and have paid, or owe the
          government $7,340,533 in royalties. It
          Is officially estimated that the Alaska
          fisheries, not including seals and
          whales, are worth $67,890,000, and since
          the purchase the territory has produc
          ed $25,000,000 of gold. Secretary Sew
          ard said that the acquisition of Alaska
          was the most important event in his
          long career, but that It would take a
          generation for the people to realise it.</text>

        <text>Seward and Alaska
          To the Editor of The Age-Herald:
          Each morning I read “Mothers
          cf Famous Men” and “Poor Boys
          Who Became Fafhous." I enjoy
          both c lumns very much, but very
          often I find that the writers of
          these columns leave out very im
          portant historical facts.
          This morning- under the head of
          “Mothers of Famous Men” was an
          article in regard to the mother
          of William H. Seward, secretary
          of state under Abraham Linoln
          and Lincoln's right hand man. But
          this article failed to say anything
          about the Alaska purchase. Mr.
          Seward was the father of this deal
          and for years before he rose to the
          president’s cabinet he had been a
          champion of the purchase of Rus
          sian America. Like Jefferson,
          Monroe and Livingston, who were
          criticised severely for the pur
          chase in 1803 of Louisiana, known
          as the American Desert, also Se
          ward was severely criticised for
          his efforts to purchase the barren
          stretch of land known as Russian
          America. which today is known as
          Alaska, the richest American pos
          session. Seward's folly proved
          one of the wisest acts in our his
          tnrv
          There 1* a strange similarity in
          the purchases of Louisiana and
          Alaska. Jefferson, Monroe and
          Livingston did not believe that
          they had purchased an empire, but
          i their main object was to eliminate
          a foreign power from our door.
          Seward did not realize that he was
          purhasing an empire when he pur
          chased Alaska; his main object
          was the elimination of a dangerous
          foreign power from our doors.
          But instead both the Louisiana and
          Alaska purchases have proven to
          be America’s richest possessions,
          and eventually Alaska will bo
          thickly settled and will take its
          place with the other section of
          the country industrially, economi
          cally and politically. At present
          still little Is known of Alaska.
          Some writers and newspapers call
          it "America’s Wonderland,” also
          our late president’s visit to our
          Northern empire has revealed
          many valuable and almost un
          known things. But what a pity
          that today very few people ac
          tually know who was responsible
          for the United States of America
          possessing this invaluable terri
          tory.</text>

          In 1SE7 Alaska was purchased from Rus
          sia by the United States, and so lightly
          was Its value held that the price paid
          $7,000,000 was generally regarded as being
          partly a present to Russia for her sup

          six years since that time the United States
          Government has received back in revenues

          A SUCCESS
          Craft Sails Skyward
          The prob
          lem of ' aerial flight without the aid of
          a balloon ' has been solved by Wilier
          and .Orville Wright of Dayton. Ohio. '
          To-day at Kitty Hawk, on the coast of
          North Carolina, they successfully navi
          gated a "flying machine of their own ln
          vention-for three. miles in the teeth'of •
          a mile gale. and. picking
          .their point of descent, easily landed the
          'machine there
          During the trial Wilber Wright occu
          pied the operator's seat and steered the
          apparatus. '.
          - The flight began from a platform con
          structed upon a 'high sandhill near
          .Kitty -Hawk. , The: machine was pro

          was a success; but" it was not until the
          third rnfle 1 had been accomplished, that
          the inventor cast his eyes about for a :

          The Wright Brothers Declare that
          They Have Solved the Problem
          of Navigating the Air.
          "Dayton, O., Jar. 6.-The Wright
          -brothers, inventors ot' the flying'
          machine which has attracted such
          widespread attention, have prepared
          the following, which they say is the
          first correct statement cf the successful
          trials made by them:
          "On the morning of Dec. 17, between
          10.30 and noon, four flights were made,
          two by Orville Wright and two by Wil?
          bur Wright. The starts were ail made
          from a point on the level and about
          200 feet west of our camp, which is
          situated a quarter of a mile north of
          Kill Devil Sand, in Dare county, N.
          C. The wind at the time of the flight
          had a velocity of 27 miles an hour at
          10 o'clock and 24 miles an hour at
          noon as recorded by the anemometer
          at the Kitty Hawk weather bureau
          station. This anemometer is 30 feet
          from the ground. Our own measure?
          ments, made with an anemometer at a
          height of fbur feet from the ground,
          showed a velocity of about 22 miles
          when the first flight was made and
          22f^ when the last flight was made.
          The flight was made directly against
          the wind. Each time the machine
          started from the level ground by its
          own power with no ssistance from
          gravity or other source whatever.
          After a run of about 40 feet along the
          monorail track which held the ma?
          chine eight inches from the groundd,
          it rose from the track and under th&amp;
          direction of the operator climbed up?
          ward on an inclined course until a
          height of eight or ten feet from the
          ground was reached, after which the
          course was kept as near horizontal as
          the wind gusts and the limited skill
          of the operator would permit. Into
          the teeth of a 25-mile gale the 'flyer'
          made its way forward with a speed of
          10 miles an hour over the ground and
          30 to 35 miles an hour through the air.
          It had previusiy been decided that for
          reasons of personal safety these first
          trials should be made as close to the
          ground as possible. The height chosen
          was scarcely sufficient for manoeuver
          ing in so gusty a wind and with no
          previous acquaintance with the con?
          duct of the machine and its controll?
          ing mechanism. Consequently the first
          flight was short. The succeeding
          flights rapidly increased in length and
          at the fourth trial a flight of 59 sec?
          onds was made in which the machine
          flew a little more than half a mile
          through the air and a distance of more
          than 852 feet over the ground. The
          landing was due to a slight error o?
          judgment on the part of the operator.
          After passing over a little hummock
          of sand in attempting to bring the
          machine down to the desired height
          the operator turned the rudder too far
          and the machine turned downward
          more quickly than had been expected.
          The reverse movement of the rudder
          was a fraction of a second too late to
          prevent the machine from touching
          the ground and thus ending the flight.
          The whole occurrence occupied little
          if any more than one second of time.

        <text> FLYING MACHINE THAT FLIES a cloth at top and bottom. It is buoyant enough of Itself
          to float its own weight and that of one man. During their .three years of experiments, the
          broth ers had added considerably to their knowledge of air currents and of the resistance
          of canvas. Keeping , these things in view, they designed and built their propelling
          apparatus. One pro peller, revolving horizontally, is placed underneath the center of the
          machine's than forty feet from tip to tip. and it weighs, entirely equipped, about seven
          hundred pounds. The achievement marks an impressive step in advance toward the every-day
          navigation of the air. ..The test in question was made at Kitty Hawk, in North Carolina.
          In the neighborhood of which place the ma chine was. launched from the top of a high sand
          dune. The aeroplane first took a downward course, but as the propeller under the engine
          increased its revolutions, began to rise slowly and steadily into the air. When the
          machine was sixty feet • above the ground the rear propeller began to do Its work, sending
          the "flyer" for ward against the wind. Wilbur Wright was able to steer his craft as he
          pleased, with the aid of the horizontal steering csar — a3 shown in our illus tration —
          and after golns three miles brought the machine gentry to the ground without difficulty or
          mishap. Professor Langley and Maxim ex perimented along the Hne3 of a real flyinj machine,
          as distinct from the dirigible balloon3 of Santos-Dumont and Lebaudy. But the eminent
          scien tist and the brilliant Inventor, with fortunes at their disposal, have not been
          rewarded with the success of these amateurish mechanicians. A ma chine, not a hiie. th^t
          propels Itself against a strong v.inl. b under steer
          age control, and lands without con
          verting itself into a scrap heap, la
          something new under the sun. — Col
          liers.
          TO sail three miles through the
          air at a speed of eight miles
          an hour against a breeze
          blowing twenty-one miles an
          hour is the most notable achievement
          in flying-machine experiments. Three
          years ago, two brothers named Wright,
          of Dayton, Ohio, went down among the
          sandhills of the North Carolina coast.
          They, were expert mechanics, and
          brought their own tools and machinery.
          They had studied the experiments of
          flying-machine inventors here and
          abroad. ¦
          The machine, in which the operator
          lies at full length, is in some ways like
          a box. kite with a rudder Instead of a
          tail. The framework is covered with
          body. The other is like the screw of a
          steamship, whirling vertically at the
          rear. .
          The machine is launched from a
          hill by merely pushing off. It can
          be .pointed in any direction and can be
          landed at will, it is strong enough to
          stand the strain of repeated trips, and
          its wings have been tested with- six
          times the load they carried last
          month. The horizontal position of the
          man in the machine saves about one
          half horsepower by diminishing the
          ivind resistance. The Wrights have
          used larger cloth surfaces than their
          predecessors. Their successful ma
          chine has. three hundred square feet
          of cloth.

          at the operator's hand causes one
          wing to lift slightly while the other Is
          correspondingly depressed, thereby In
          creasing the angle of resistance in one
          wing and decreasing it In the other

        <text> AERONAUTIC EXPERIMENTS. Inventors who wish to utilize the aeroplane In navigating the
          air will do well to take note of an expedient tried a few days ago by a Fren?_hman. He
          demonstrated that by conduct? ing experiments over the water other advan? tages might be
          secured than the one pointed out long ago by ?dhanute, an American engineer. Not only can
          the aeronnut who adopts that pre? caution dimmish thereby the risk of Injuring himself and
          his apparatus if he has a fall, but he can also facilitate the operation of launch? ing.
          M. Voisin, to whose recent attempts ref? erence is made, adjusted his apparatus lightly on
          a small raft on the Seine, and employed a fast motor boat to tow him. The proceeding was
          very much like flying a kite. As soon as the outstretched planes of M. Yoisin's machine
          acquired a rapid forward motion it rose gently. Being well balanced, it attained an
          el??vation of eighty f?2et In a few seconds, and then slowly descended, the headway gained
          before casting off the towiope s-arving to drive it about one thousand feet. Before a
          flying machine can be said to lie reasonably successful it must show that It will travel
          In a generally horizontal direction, that it can be steen-d, and that it is so p-arfoctly
          uuder control that it will land gracefully where its pilot wish.-s. i'.tit th?* first
          essential is to start. With airships of the type wMdi Beatos iMimont and di?? ].. l.auly
          brothers h:ive. uswl
          the operation of launching is an easy one. The
          unfortunate consequences of Mr. Manlys his?
          toric attempt to exhibit the merits of Pro?
          fessor Langley s machine eighteen or twenty
          months ago illustrate the d.i?iculties of eff-ect?
          Ing an ascent with the aeroplane. Reliance
          was placed by him on powerful springs, to
          hoist the apparatus as well as to send it for?
          ward, at tho Instant of starting, and it was
          hoped that the gasolene engines and screw
          propellers would do the rest. They did not,
          however, although the aerodrome may have
          derived some benefit from Its having been
          mounted previously on the roof of a house?
          boat. If it had rested on a raft designed so
          that it could be drawn quickly througii the
          water, perhaps it might have been persuaded to
          rise and show what it could do.
          The experiment made by M. Voisin in the
          ; vicinity of Paris is only one of many which
          | may be expected during the season which has
          | now opened. The aeroplane which was tested
          j last week resembles in a mensure that of the
          ? Wright brothers, of Dayton, Ohio. Its de?
          signer Is M. Ernest Archdeacon, a well known
          French devotee of aeronautic science. Other
          machines of the same class have been planned,
          if not already built, to compete for a prize of?
          fered by M. Deutsch. To the man who first
          succeeds ln travelling one kilometre and re?
          turning over the same course with an aero?
          plane he will give $5,000. M. Archdeacon has
          tried to raise a similar sum by popular sub?
          scription for kindred purposes. Five thousand
          dollars may not go far toward reimbursing an
          inventor for his outlay In ventures of this kind,
          but a great stimulus will be Imparted to in?
          genuity and ambition by the chance of win?
          ning the fame which would accompany these
          prizes.
          Such encouragement certainly ought to ex?
          ert much influence. The cigar shaped gasbag
          has now attained a development which gives a
          fair indication of its possibilities. The improve?
          ment of it will hereafter be little more than
          a matter of detail. The problems presented by
          the aeroplane have not been worked out so
          fully. In order to demonstrate whether it will
          ever realize the hopes of Its champions a good
          deal of study and practical work is yet needed,
          and it is gratifying to see a prospect of fresh
          endeavor in that direction.

          These experiment have from the
          first puuled most persons interested
          in the progress "f aviation, beeaus
          the installment of a motor in the

          al success and no motor 1 used in
          the machine whbh la being tested in
          the Kitty Hawk sandhills. It is evl-
          denr. however, that, for the purpose
          of pel fet ting the motor-driven ma
          chine, th" Wright are going back to
          first principles In search of a way in
          which to keep an aeroplane automat
          ically upon an even keel.
          With the secrecy which ha charact

          nected with the aileron and a the;
          aeroplane dip from aide to lde grav
          ity cause the pendulum to awing.
          Thl swinging would have a tendency
          to operate the ailerons up and down
          and to restore stability.
          Vnttl very recently aviator have
          looked upon automatic balancing de
          vice with dlfavor, a none of them
          had succeeded In restoring the equi
          librium of an aeroplane after It had
          been lost. A sudden xust of wind or
          an "air pocket," It was aald, would
          do the fatal work In less than the
          time whlth the stability device took
          to operate. Hand control, accordingly,
          tin been depended upon almost ex
          clusively in such cae.
          Kxcept for the gucces which ap
          parently ha attended the present
          test of the new Wright glider, there
          Is nothing very new In their under
          lying theory. Lillenthal, a few months
          before he fell to hks death, wrote:
          "I am now engaged In constructing
          an apparatus In which the position
          of the wings can be changed during
          flight In uch a way that the bal
          anclng Is not affected by changing the
          center of gravity of the body, In
          niy opinion thl mean considerable
          progress, as It will Increase the safe
          ty." And Professor John J. Montgom
          ery of Santa Clara College, Califor
          nia, one of the pioneer stutients oi
          aviation In the I'nlted Sttes, was
          partly successful In evolving a glider
          that wa able to maintain It equilib
          rium. None of tho old gliders, however,
          ev er remained In the air for the space
          of a minute, whereas Orvllle Wright
          has succeeded In doing so for ten
          time that length of time. What i
          singular, too, about the Wright In
          vention I that the operator I not
          trapped Into a harness, In which po
          sition he would be depended on hi
          own exertions to make any headway,
          but occupies a seat and works lever
          connected with the planes to keep
          himself aloft.
          It seems evident that after the
          Wright' machine has been further
          tested for equilibrium a motor will be
          Installed. At present, the Inference
          Is, the plane and rudder and control
          appliances are so novel that It Is con-
          Idered loo hazardous to drive the
          machine with a motor.

          £f£ Qf MACHINES
          AERIAL NAVIGATION NEAR, SAYS
          FRANK H. LAHM.
          Public Demonstration Expected Soon
          From the Wright Brothers—Predic
          tion that Their Work Will Be Ac
          cepted by the Public.
          Scientists are expecting soon a
          public demonstration of the Wright
          brothers' flying machine, whose re
          ported success has been a subject of
          continued controversy on both sides
          of the Atlantic. Frank H. Lahm, an
          American resident of Paris, who will
          be the foreign representative of the
          Aero Club of America in Europe this
          year, believes that this trial will set
          tle once and for all the actual value
          of the Wright brothers' invention.
          Mr. Lahm is not given to fads, nor
          has he wasted much time in idle
          theory. He is a conservative Ameri
          can business man, representing one
          of our largest industries abroad. At
          the same time, he ia an enthusiastic
          balloonist. While at home in Ohio
          on a visit, he called upon the Wrights
          at Dayton, and talked with bankers,
          business and professional men of that
          city who have seen the Wright bro
          thers operate their invention at will
          In the air, and make both long and
          short flights. Mr Lahm declared
          without reservation his belief in the
          success of flying machines, that their
          permanent use is assured, and that
          the public must take them seriously.
